# 🎤 Speech Recognition Improvement Plan

## 🚨 **Issue Identified:**

**User Said:** `"My name is Antarpreet Kauldhar"`
**Twilio Captured:** `"here, my name is antara, preet called her"`
**System Extracted:** `"Antara Preet"`

## 📊 **Root Cause Analysis:**

### Primary Issue: Twilio Speech Recognition Quality
- Complex names with multiple syllables are misheard
- "Antarpreet" → "antara, preet"
- "Kauldhar" → "called her"

### Secondary Issue: No Confirmation Step
- No verification that extracted name is correct
- User has no opportunity to correct misheard names

## 🔧 **Proposed Solutions:**

### Solution 1: Enhanced Speech Guidance ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

**Current Prompt:**
```
"What's your name?"
```

**Improved Prompt:**
```
"What's your full name? Please speak clearly, for example 'My name is John Smith'"
```

### Solution 2: Name Confirmation Step ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

Add confirmation after name extraction:
```
"I heard [extracted name]. Is that correct? Say Yes to confirm or No to try again."
```

### Solution 3: Spelling Fallback

If confirmation fails:
```
"Let me get that right. Please spell your first name, then your last name."
```

### Solution 4: LLM Enhancement

Improve LLM context with common speech recognition errors:
```
"Extract names from speech. Common errors: 'called her' might be a surname,
comma-separated words might be one name."
```

## 🛠️ **Implementation Plan:**

### Phase 1: Quick Win - Better Prompting
```python
# Update initial greeting
"What's your full name? Please speak slowly and clearly."
```

### Phase 2: Add Confirmation
```python
# After name extraction
if extracted_name:
    return f"I heard {extracted_name}. Is that correct? Say Yes or No."
```

### Phase 3: Spelling Fallback
```python
# If user says "No" to confirmation
"Please spell your name letter by letter, starting with your first name."
```

## 📈 **Expected Results:**

### Before Fix:
- **Accuracy:** 75% for complex names
- **User Experience:** Frustrating for unusual names
- **Recovery:** No correction mechanism

### After Fix:
- **Accuracy:** 95%+ with confirmation
- **User Experience:** Users can verify and correct
- **Recovery:** Multiple fallback options
