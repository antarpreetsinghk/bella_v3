# üõ°Ô∏è Production Database Testing - Safety Checklist

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Read Before Running Production Tests

This checklist ensures safe execution of production database tests without affecting real customer data.

---

## üìã Pre-Flight Safety Checks

### ‚úÖ 1. Database Configuration Verification

**BEFORE running any production database tests, verify:**

- [ ] **Database URL is CORRECT**
  ```bash
  echo $PRODUCTION_DB_URL
  # Should point to TEST/STAGING database, NOT production customer database
  ```

- [ ] **Database is TEST/STAGING only**
  - Verify with your database administrator
  - Check database name (should contain "test", "staging", or "dev")
  - Confirm NO real customer data exists in this database

- [ ] **Test mode is ENABLED**
  ```bash
  echo $PRODUCTION_DB_TEST_MODE
  # Should be: true
  ```

- [ ] **Auto-cleanup is ENABLED**
  ```bash
  echo $TEST_DATA_AUTO_CLEANUP
  # Should be: true
  ```

### ‚úÖ 2. Migration Status

- [ ] **Database schema is up-to-date**
  ```bash
  alembic current
  # Should show: bf439ec8d57f or later (is_test_data migration)
  ```

- [ ] **is_test_data column exists**
  ```bash
  # Connect to database and verify:
  \d appointments
  # Should show: is_test_data | boolean | not null | default false
  ```

- [ ] **Index exists for fast cleanup**
  ```sql
  SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes
  WHERE tablename = 'appointments' AND indexname = 'ix_appointments_is_test_data';
  -- Should return: ix_appointments_is_test_data
  ```

### ‚úÖ 3. Cleanup Utilities Verification

- [ ] **Cleanup script is accessible**
  ```bash
  python tests/production/cleanup.py count --db-url="$PRODUCTION_DB_URL"
  # Should execute without errors
  ```

- [ ] **Dry-run mode works**
  ```bash
  python tests/production/cleanup.py cleanup --db-url="$PRODUCTION_DB_URL" --older-than=0
  # Should show: [DRY RUN] with found count
  ```

- [ ] **Manual cleanup is tested**
  ```bash
  # Create a test appointment, then cleanup in dry-run mode
  python tests/production/cleanup.py verify --db-url="$PRODUCTION_DB_URL"
  ```

### ‚úÖ 4. External Service Configuration

- [ ] **Google Calendar is configured correctly**
  - If testing calendar integration, verify service account
  - Check calendar ID is test calendar, not production
  - Test calendar permissions are read/write

- [ ] **Twilio webhook URL points to test environment**
  ```bash
  echo $PRODUCTION_TEST_URL
  # Should be staging/test environment, NOT live production
  ```

- [ ] **API keys are for test environment**
  ```bash
  echo $PRODUCTION_API_KEY
  # Verify with team this is test/staging key
  ```

### ‚úÖ 5. Test Data Isolation Verification

**Run this verification before first test:**

```bash
# Check that test data flag works
pytest tests/production/test_production_database_flow.py::TestProductionDataCleanup::test_cleanup_identifies_test_data -v
```

Expected output:
- ‚úÖ Test passes
- ‚úÖ No errors about is_test_data column
- ‚úÖ Cleanup utilities can query test data

---

## üö® During Test Execution

### Monitor These Indicators

1. **Test Data Markers**
   - Every test should create appointments with `is_test_data=True`
   - Check test output for "is_test_data" confirmations

2. **Database Connection**
   - Watch for connection errors
   - Monitor connection pool usage
   - Check for deadlocks or timeouts

3. **Cleanup Execution**
   - Verify cleanup messages after each test
   - Check that `test_appointment_ids` are tracked
   - Confirm deletions are executed

4. **Error Handling**
   - Any database errors should be investigated immediately
   - Stop tests if you see warnings about customer data

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING SIGNS - STOP IMMEDIATELY IF:

- ‚ùå Tests fail to create `is_test_data=True` appointments
- ‚ùå Cleanup is skipped or fails
- ‚ùå Database shows production customer data
- ‚ùå Connection errors or permission denied
- ‚ùå Unexpected appointment counts or data corruption
- ‚ùå Google Calendar events created in production calendar

**If any warning sign appears: STOP TESTS and run cleanup verification**

---

## üîç Post-Test Verification

### After test suite completes:

1. **Verify Cleanup Executed**
   ```bash
   python tests/production/cleanup.py verify --db-url="$PRODUCTION_DB_URL"
   ```

   Expected output:
   - Total test appointments: should be 0 or very low
   - Stale test data: should be 0
   - Cleanup recommended: NO

2. **Check for Orphaned Test Data**
   ```bash
   python tests/production/cleanup.py summary --db-url="$PRODUCTION_DB_URL"
   ```

   Look for:
   - Age distribution (should be mostly recent)
   - No appointments older than 24 hours (unless intended)

3. **Manual Database Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*), MAX(created_at), MIN(created_at)
   FROM appointments
   WHERE is_test_data = true;
   ```

   - Count should be low (< 10 unless actively testing)
   - Timestamps should be very recent

4. **Google Calendar Cleanup** (if integration enabled)
   - Check test calendar for orphaned events
   - Delete any events with "TEST" or test names

---

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### If Real Customer Data is Affected

1. **STOP ALL TESTS IMMEDIATELY**
   ```bash
   # Kill all running pytest processes
   pkill -f "pytest.*production"
   ```

2. **Assess Damage**
   ```sql
   -- Check if any real appointments were modified
   SELECT * FROM appointments
   WHERE is_test_data = false
   AND updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
   ```

3. **Rollback if Possible**
   - If within transaction: rollback
   - If committed: restore from backup
   - Contact database administrator immediately

4. **Document Incident**
   - What tests were running
   - Time of incident
   - Database state before/after
   - Steps taken to recover

### If Cleanup Fails

1. **Manual Cleanup Procedure**
   ```bash
   # Force cleanup (NO DRY RUN - use with caution)
   python tests/production/cleanup.py cleanup \
     --db-url="$PRODUCTION_DB_URL" \
     --older-than=0 \
     --no-dry-run \
     --limit=1000
   ```

2. **Verify Deletion**
   ```bash
   python tests/production/cleanup.py count --db-url="$PRODUCTION_DB_URL"
   ```

3. **If Still Failing**
   ```sql
   -- LAST RESORT: Manual SQL cleanup
   -- VERIFY this query carefully before running
   DELETE FROM appointments
   WHERE is_test_data = true
   AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
   RETURNING id, user_id, created_at;
   ```

### If Database Connection Lost

1. **Check connection status**
   ```bash
   psql "$PRODUCTION_DB_URL" -c "SELECT 1;"
   ```

2. **Verify database is running**
   - Check with hosting provider
   - Check database server status
   - Verify network connectivity

3. **Do NOT retry tests** until connection is stable
