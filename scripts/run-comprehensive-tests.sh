# Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment ✅

- [x] All security tools installed and configured
- [x] Performance monitoring active
- [x] Cost tracking implemented
- [x] Test suite passing
- [x] CI/CD pipeline enhanced
- [x] Google Calendar integration ready

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Google Calendar (Optional - 5 minutes)
```bash
# Set environment variables:
export GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ENABLED=true
export GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='...'
export GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=primary
export BUSINESS_EMAIL=your-email@company.com
# Restart service
```

### 2. Cost Monitoring (Optional)
```bash
# For real AWS data:
aws configure  # Add Cost Explorer permissions
# Dashboard available at: cost-reports/dashboard.html
```

### 3. Security Monitoring (Active)
```bash
# Automated security scans running daily
# Reports available in: security-reports/
```

### 4. Performance Monitoring (Active)
```bash
# Real-time monitoring active
# Metrics available at: /performance/health
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Health checks passing: `/healthz`
- [ ] Performance metrics good: `/performance/health`
- [ ] Voice booking functional: Test with real call
- [ ] Calendar events created (if enabled)
- [ ] Cost tracking active: Check dashboard
- [ ] Security alerts configured

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert to previous container image
2. Check AWS ECS service health
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Review CloudWatch logs

## Success Metrics

- Response time: <3 seconds
- Availability: >99.9%
- Error rate: <1%
- Cost: Within budget ($120/month)
