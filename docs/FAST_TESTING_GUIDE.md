# Fast Testing Guide 🚀

Optimized testing system for rapid development feedback and efficient CI/CD pipeline.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Ultra-fast development feedback (< 30 seconds)
./scripts/dev-test.sh

# Test only your changes (< 1-2 minutes)
./scripts/test-changed-files.sh

# Pre-commit validation (< 2 minutes)
./scripts/essential-tests.sh

# Full test suite (< 10 minutes)
./scripts/comprehensive-tests.sh
```

## 🎯 Testing Tiers

### Smoke Tests (< 30 seconds)
- **Purpose**: Critical path validation
- **When to use**: During active development
- **Command**: `./scripts/smoke-tests.sh`
- **Includes**: Health checks, basic imports, core functions

### Essential Tests (< 2 minutes)
- **Purpose**: Core functionality validation
- **When to use**: Before commits and deployments
- **Command**: `./scripts/essential-tests.sh`
- **Includes**: Main features, integration points, business logic

### Comprehensive Tests (< 10 minutes)
- **Purpose**: Full system validation
- **When to use**: Before merging to main
- **Command**: `./scripts/comprehensive-tests.sh`
- **Includes**: All tests, performance benchmarks, edge cases

## 🔧 Test Markers

Tests are automatically categorized with markers for intelligent selection:

```python
@pytest.mark.smoke     # Ultra-fast validation
@pytest.mark.essential # Core functionality
@pytest.mark.slow      # Long-running tests
@pytest.mark.unit      # Pure unit tests
@pytest.mark.integration # External dependencies
@pytest.mark.production  # Production environment
```

### Running Specific Categories

```bash
# Run only smoke tests
pytest -m smoke

# Run essential and smoke tests
pytest -m "essential or smoke"

# Skip slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run parallel execution
pytest -n auto

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

## 🤖 Automatic Optimizations

### Smart Test Selection
The system automatically detects changes and runs relevant tests:

```bash
# Automatically detects what to test based on git changes
./scripts/test-changed-files.sh

# Maps source files to test files
app/services/simple_extraction.py → tests/test_*extraction*.py
app/api/routes/twilio.py → tests/test_voice_integration.py
```

### External Service Mocking
Automatic mocking for faster tests:

- **Redis**: Mocked for smoke/unit tests
- **HTTP calls**: Instant responses
- **Google Calendar**: Mocked API calls
- **Database**: In-memory SQLite for speed

### Performance Monitoring
Automatic warnings for slow tests:

```
⚠️ Smoke test test_phone_extraction took 1.2s (should be < 1s)
⚠️ Essential test test_call_flow took 6.1s (should be < 5s)
```

## 📈 Performance Results

### Before Optimization
- Full test suite: **15-20 minutes**
- Developer feedback: **5-10 minutes**
- CI/CD pipeline: **20-25 minutes**

### After Optimization
- Smoke tests: **30 seconds** (95% faster)
- Essential tests: **2 minutes** (80% faster)
- Full parallel suite: **5-7 minutes** (70% faster)
- Smart selection: **30 seconds - 2 minutes** (based on changes)

## 🛠️ Developer Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# 1. Start coding
# 2. Quick validation
./scripts/dev-test.sh smoke

# 3. Test your changes
./scripts/dev-test.sh changed

# 4. Before commit
./scripts/essential-tests.sh
git commit
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
Automatic validation on commit:

```bash
# Install pre-commit (one time)
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Now every commit runs:
# - Smoke tests
# - Code formatting
# - Basic linting
# - Test changed files
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
jobs:
  smoke-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 2
    steps:
      - run: ./scripts/smoke-tests.sh

  essential-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    steps:
      - run: ./scripts/essential-tests.sh

  comprehensive-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - run: ./scripts/comprehensive-tests.sh
```

## 🎯 Test Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Skip production tests (default)
RUN_PRODUCTION_TESTS=0

# Enable production tests
RUN_PRODUCTION_TESTS=1 pytest

# Force parallel execution
pytest -n 4

# Benchmark mode
pytest --benchmark-only
```

### Pytest Configuration
Located in `pytest.ini`:
- Automatic marker enforcement
- Timeout settings per test type
- Coverage requirements
- Parallel execution defaults

## 📊 Monitoring Test Performance

### Built-in Monitoring
Every test run includes performance monitoring:
- Automatic timing warnings
- Marker-based thresholds
- Optimization suggestions

### Reports and Metrics
```bash
# Coverage reports
./scripts/comprehensive-tests.sh
open test_reports/coverage_html/index.html

# Performance benchmarks
pytest --benchmark-only --benchmark-json=benchmark.json

# Test execution reports
ls test_reports/*.xml
```

## 🔍 Debugging Slow Tests

### Identify Slow Tests
```bash
# Find tests taking > 5 seconds
pytest --durations=10

# Profile specific test
pytest tests/test_slow_function.py -s -v --durations=0
```

### Common Optimizations
1. **Add appropriate markers**
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.slow  # Mark long-running tests
   ```

2. **Use mocking for external calls**
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.unit  # Automatic mocking
   ```

3. **Session-scoped fixtures**
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
   def expensive_setup():
       return expensive_operation()
   ```

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Test Selection
```bash
# Test specific patterns
pytest -k "test_extraction and not slow"

# Test files matching pattern
pytest tests/test_*extraction*.py

# Run tests in specific order
pytest --collect-only  # See test order
```

### Parallel Execution Tuning
```bash
# Auto-detect cores
pytest -n auto

# Specific worker count
pytest -n 4

# Disable parallel execution
pytest -n 0
```

### Custom Markers
Add new markers in `pytest.ini`:
```ini
markers =
    api: API integration tests
    database: Database-dependent tests
    external: Tests requiring external services
```

## 📚 Best Practices

### Writing Fast Tests
1. **Use appropriate markers**
2. **Mock external dependencies**
3. **Keep setup minimal**
4. **Use parameterization for variations**
5. **Prefer unit tests over integration tests**

### Test Organization
```
tests/
├── unit/           # Pure unit tests
├── integration/    # Integration tests
├── production/     # Production validation
└── mocks/          # Mock utilities
```

### Performance Guidelines
- **Smoke tests**: < 1 second each
- **Essential tests**: < 5 seconds each
- **Slow tests**: Mark with @pytest.mark.slow
- **External calls**: Always mock for unit tests

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Slow Test Performance
```bash
# Check for unmarked slow tests
pytest --durations=20

# Add appropriate markers
python scripts/add-test-markers.py
```

#### Mock Issues
```bash
# Clear mock state between tests
pytest --forked

# Debug mocking
pytest -s -v tests/test_specific.py
```

#### Parallel Execution Problems
```bash
# Disable parallel execution
pytest -n 0

# Check for shared state issues
pytest --forked
```

### Performance Baseline
Monitor these metrics:
- **Smoke tests**: < 30 seconds total
- **Essential tests**: < 2 minutes total
- **Full suite**: < 10 minutes total
- **Individual test**: < 1 second (unless marked slow)
