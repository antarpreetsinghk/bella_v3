## üíº **Development Workflow**

### **üéØ Professional Development Process**

#### **1. Issue Identification & Planning**
```bash
# Create detailed issue with business justification

- Technical specification and requirements
- Security and compliance considerations
- Testing strategy and acceptance criteria
- Documentation requirements
```

#### **2. Feature Branch Development**
```bash
# Create feature branch with descriptive naming
git checkout -b feature/enterprise-calendar-integration
git checkout -b security/implement-oauth2-scopes
git checkout -b performance/optimize-voice-processing
git checkout -b docs/api-integration-guide
```

#### **3. Implementation Standards**
```python
# Example: Professional code structure
class EnterpriseFeature:
    """
    Enterprise-grade feature implementation.

    This class implements [feature] according to enterprise standards
    including security, performance, and compliance requirements.

    Security Considerations:
    - All inputs validated against security policy
    - Access controls enforced at method level
    - Audit logging for all operations

    Compliance Notes:
    - GDPR Article 25 (Data Protection by Design)
    - SOC 2 Type II control requirements
    """

    def __init__(self, security_context: SecurityContext):
        self.security = security_context
        self.audit_logger = get_audit_logger(__name__)

    @require_permission("enterprise.feature.access")
    @audit_log_operation
    def execute_business_operation(self, validated_input: BusinessInput) -> BusinessResult:
        """Execute business operation with full enterprise controls."""
        # Implementation with security, logging, and error handling
        pass
```

#### **4. Comprehensive Testing**
```bash
# Required test coverage standards
pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-min=90

# Performance testing
locust -f tests/performance/load_tests.py

# Security testing
pytest tests/security/ -v

# Integration testing
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# End-to-end testing
pytest tests/e2e/ -v
```

#### **5. Code Quality Assurance**
```bash
# Automated quality checks
black app/                    # Code formatting
isort app/                   # Import organization
flake8 app/                  # Style compliance
mypy app/                    # Type checking
pylint app/                  # Code quality analysis
```
